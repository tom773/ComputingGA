  <h2>Burning Down The House
  </h2>Watch out you might get what you&#039;re after
<br>Boom babies strange but not a stranger
<br>I&#039;m an ordinary guy
<br>Burning down the house
<br>Hold tight wait till the party&#039;s over
<br>Hold tight We&#039;re in for nasty weather
<br>There has got to be a way
<br>Burning down the house
<br>Here&#039;s your ticket pack your bag
<br>Time for jumpin&#039; overboard
<br>The transportation is here
<br>Close enough but not too far,
<br>Maybe you know where you are
<br>Fightin&#039; fire with fire
<br>All wet! Hey you might need a raincoat
<br>Shakedown! Dreams walking in broad daylight
<br>Three hun-dred six-ty five de-grees
<br>Burning down the house
<br>It was once upon a place sometimes I listen to myself
<br>Gonna come in first place
<br>People on their way to work and baby what did you except
<br>Gonna burst into flame
<br>My house! Is out of the ordinary
<br>That&#039;s right! Don&#039;t wanna hurt nobody
<br>Some things sure can sweep me off my feet
<br>Burning down the house
<br>No visible means of support and you have not seen nothin&#039; yet
<br>Everything&#039;s stuck together
<br>And I don&#039;t know what you expect starring into the TV set
<br>Fighting fire with fire
<br>

  <h2>Listen, Marxist!
  </h2>All the old crap of the thirties is coming back again&#8212;the shit about the &quot;class line,&quot; the &quot;role of the working class,&quot; the &quot;trained cadres,&quot; the &quot;vanguard party,&quot; and the &quot;proletarian dictatorship.&quot; It&#039;s all back again, and in a more vulgarized form than ever. The Progressive Labor Party is not the only example, it is merely the worst. One smells the same shit in various offshoots of SDS, and in the Marxist and Socialist clubs on campuses, not to speak of the Trotskyist groups, the International Socialist Clubs, and Youth Against War and Fascism.
<br>
<br>In the thirties, at least it was understandable. The United States was paralyzed by a chronic economic crisis, the deepest and longest in its history. The only living forces that seemed to be battering at the walls of capitalism were the great organizing drives of the CIO, with their dramatic sit-down strikes, their radical militancy, and their bloody clashes with the police. The political atmosphere throughout the entire world was charged by the electricity of the Spanish Civil War, the last of the classical workers&#039; revolutions, when every radical sect in the American left could identify with its own militia columns in Madrid and Barcelona. That was thirty years ago. It was a time when anyone who cried out &quot;Make love, not war&quot; would have been regarded as a freak; the cry then was &quot;Make jobs, not war&quot;&#8212;the cry of an age burdened by scarcity, when the achievement of socialism entailed &quot;sacrifices&quot; and a &quot;transition period&quot; to an economy of material abundance. To an eighteen-year-old kid in 1937 the very concept of cybernation would have seemed like the wildest science fiction, a fantasy comparable to visions of space travel. That eighteen-year-old kid has now reached fifty years of age, and his roots are planted in an era so remote as to differ qualitatively from the realities of the present period in the United States. Capitalism itself has changed since then, taking on increasingly statified forms that could be anticipated only dimly thirty years ago. And now we are being asked to go back to the &quot;class line,&quot; the &quot;strategies,&quot; the &quot;cadres&quot; and the organizational forms of that distant period in almost blatant disregard of the new issues and possibilities that have emerged.

  <h1>Mt Gox
  </h1>A small company named
  <a href='https://www.mtgox.com'>Mt Gox
  </a>took most of the world's Bitcoin trades from 2013 to 2014. They don't now. Why is that?
  <h2>The first failure
  </h2>In 2011, a cracker accessed a staff account on Mt Gox and used it to crash their price. The cracker transferred a large number of bitcoins to themselves and sold them using the exchange's automatic selling program, dropping the apparent price down to one cent. Fortunately, Mt Gox still had control over the coins, and the damage was not permanent, proving so by transferring the coins from cold storage to another address controlled by the website.

</sup>They were able to reset the ownership of the coins on the website, and trading was back to normal soon after. 
  <h2>Bitcoin theft
  </h2>From 7 Feburary 2014, Mt Gox started showing issues. Withdrawls were halted, after the owners discovered transactions could be modified ("malleability") while still appearing valid to Bitcoin nodes. 
  <h2>A Bitcoin Suicide
  </h2>On The 4th of December, 2017 a disturbing post hit the r/bitcoin subreddit detailing the hard struggles of man who lost millions in Bitcoin the Mt Gox hack.
  <br>At the time the Bitcoin was not worth much however with the metoric rise of the cryptocurrency in late 2017 came individuals who had spent many Bitcoins in the past kicking themselves.
  <br>Unfortunatley this proved to much for one individual who's lost bitcoin amounted to almost $159,000,000, and he had no way of getting it back. He sadly took his own life late November, 2017. R.I.P

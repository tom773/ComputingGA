  <h1>The 2014 Mt Gox Breach
  </h1>A small company named
  <a href='https://www.mtgox.com'>Mt Gox
  </a>took most of the world's Bitcoin trades from 2013 to 2014. They don't now. Why is that?

  <h1>The first failure
  </h1>In 2011, a cracker accessed a staff account on Mt Gox and used it to crash their price. The cracker transferred a large number of bitcoins to themselves and sold them using the exchange's automatic selling program, dropping the apparent price down to one cent. Fortunately, Mt Gox still had control over the coins, and the damage was not permanent, proving so by transferring the coins from cold storage to another address controlled by the website.
